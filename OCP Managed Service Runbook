# OCP Managed Service Runbook

As Rob Ewaschuk [puts it](https://docs.google.com/document/d/199PqyG3UsyXlwieHaqbGiWVa8eMWi8zzAn0YfcApr8Q/edit#):
> Playbooks (or runbooks) are an important part of an alerting system; it's best to have an entry for each alert or family of alerts that catch a symptom, which can further explain what the alert means and how it might be addressed.
